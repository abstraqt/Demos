*Coercing others for their own sake is very extreme. But positive liberty is much bigger than that. Coercion can be done for everyone’s sake, or for vulnerable groups, like people with mental or physical disabilities. If restaurants have to have ramps in an area, that’s positive liberty in action.*

Both positive and negative liberty are both necessary. If you hypothetically removed all negative liberty, then people have no agency. And if you hypothetically removed all positive liberty, then it could be **de jure **liberty for all, but **de facto**, liberty for the powerful.

A good balance to strike does not have to be the same for different types of entity or different countries. In many cases there may not be a best balance to strike because there are too many competing interests.
