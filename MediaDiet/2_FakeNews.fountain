**Fake News**

It sucks that fake news exists.

But we can be thankful that it probably isn’t as widespread as you think. 

Because there is lots of bad news that isn’t fake.

Fake news is news that is actually false, an outright fabrication where the main point of the article has no basis in reality.

Journalism is far from perfect, but there are a tonne of ways to bend the truth without breaking it.

Fake news is a serious allegation. 

We need a more nuanced approach to criticizing media.
